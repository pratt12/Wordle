## Checkout the famous Wordle's clone
Tried replicating the wordle game which challenges people to guess the five letter word in six tries. If the chosen letter is not a part of the word, it will be highlighted as black.
If the chosen letter is a part of the word, but it's at the wrong location, it will be marked as Yellow while the correct positioned letter will become green.
