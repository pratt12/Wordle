## Checkout the famous Wordle's clone
Tried replicating the wordle game which challenges people to guess the five letter word in six tries. If the chosen letter is not a part of the word, it will be highlighted as black.
If the chosen letter is a part of the word, but it's at the wrong location, it will be marked as Yellow while the correct positioned letter will become green.<br/>
The dictionary and target words were pulled from Wordle's JSON itself and it was directly used in the JSCode for all the cloning purpose.

As it is visible, the word was "BANAL". Don't worry it's a weird word and it just a stroke of luck, I was looking to try every combination from the words like CANAL and others.
